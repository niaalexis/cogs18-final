    "My project was inspired by Assignment 3.  My main goal was to create a chat bot that simulates talking to a cowboy (or a cowboT), named Billy the Kidbot.  While coming up with things to say, I realized there really was no point in talking to a cowbot if you couldn't go on an adventure with him.  So, I added a Choose Your Own Adventure feature to the assignment where the user can help him get back into town by chatting to him as one would to a friend over text. I chose not to give options that were too short in wording such as 'horse' instead of 'take your horse' because I didn't want to lose the chatbot feel.  I also made sure to keep the original chat line so that you could still simply talk to him!  You can say 'howdy' to him, 'yeehaw', and more, or you can say 'take me on an adventure' and help him home through 2nd person commands (e.g. take YOUR horse).  You can also say 'quit' to escape both chat lines and end the simulation."
